# JsAdditionalStringMethods

Due to limitations on the inbuilt String object in JavaScript in terms of inbuilt methods available, I have decided to create some useful methods which will be available to the String object. Feel Free to use any of them.

However You should be kind enough to give credit to the right source. In this case Me. Thanks A Lot.
